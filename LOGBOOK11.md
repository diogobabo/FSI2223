### Task 1

First, we copied the openssl.cnf config file to our working directory

Then, we changed the config file, created the necessary auxiliary files and generated the self-signed CA file

Next, we ran the commands to look at the decoded content of the files:  `openssl x509 -in ca.crt -text -noout` and `openssl rsa -in ca.key -text -noout`
